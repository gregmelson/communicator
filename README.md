# Communicator ðŸ”Š

A collection of audio-based tools designed for fun, utility, and experimentation â€” starting with a high-frequency **Mosquito Repeller** that only kids can hear (or so they say ðŸ‘€).

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… High-frequency audio tone generator (17kHz)
- âœ… Installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA)
- âœ… Offline support via Service Worker
- âœ… Works on mobile and desktop browsers

## ðŸ“¦ Current App: Mosquito Repeller

The initial tool plays a sound around 17,000 Hz â€” often perceptible only to younger ears. Great for playful experiments with your kids (or as a summoning bell ðŸ˜„).

## ðŸ“² Install Instructions (PWA)

1. Open the site in your browser (Chrome or Safari recommended).
2. Tap the browser menu (â‹® or share icon).
3. Choose **"Add to Home screen"** or **"Install App"**.
4. Done! The app will run offline too.
