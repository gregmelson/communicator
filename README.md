# communicator
This repo is named communicator because I plan to build a set of audio-based tools, starting with a high-frequency mosquito repeller. If the project were limited to just that feature, it wouldâ€™ve been named mosquito-repeller, but I aim to expand it into a broader sound communication toolkit over time.
